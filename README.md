Forgery
======


---

Forgery is an open-source alternative to Valve's Hammer Editor for the Goldsource engine.
It is written in .NET and uses [Veldrid][2] for rendering, with DirectX 10.

Forgery supports Goldsource mapping but is rather incomplete and buggy. Please consider the following alternate projects:

- [TrenchBroom](https://github.com/kduske/TrenchBroom) (as of writing, has partial support for HL, hopefully more support is coming)
- Valve Hammer Editor
- [JACK](http://jack.hlfx.ru/en/download.html) (the free version, don't pay for it)
- Older editors such as QuArK, BSP, Radiant, etc.

The Forgery Editor is licensed under BSD-3.
